# KY-UFO
Small reverse engineering of the KY UFO application that was being used for my Aliexpress GT8 Drone. This is a python script for Windows that when connected to the drone's WiFi network, it will open the video feed through ffplay and allow to switch cameras by typing C on the terminal. There are a few things that I could implement like mirroring video or controlling the drone, but I won't be implementing these (but if you do, you can send a pull request), because the video mirror feature is useless for me, and the controls through WiFi have a terrible delay
